What is my MVP:
    My Minimum Viable Product will rank games based on users giving the game a score of 1-10 after viewing prices, ratings, and descriptions of the games. It will also show a personalized list of games (specifically a list of games that the user has rated).

  * Figure out which API's I want to use.
  * Figure out how I want to store my data.(MySQL?)
  * Determine if I want to just create an API that can be used by discord, or if I want to create that plus a client side application.
