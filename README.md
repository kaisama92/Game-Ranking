## Description

_{This application interfaces with RAWG's Api to pull information from their database based on a search string entered by the user, plus some behind the scenes parameters. Then users can add the games to the game list where they can choose to upvote or downvote list items. Each game is restricted to 1 upvote or downvote each. Also only the site admin can delete entries from the website. Created as my Capstone for Epicodus.}_
